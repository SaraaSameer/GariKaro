## Overview

Gari Karo is a car pooling management system which helps users to find rides in a short period
of time. It not only aids travelers but also drivers who are traveling alone can ask for fellow
passengers through our application. Initially this project is aimed for the students of FAST
NUCES-Karachi only.

## Project Goals

<ul>
<li>Functional Goals: It allows users to add a new ride and search for available rides
using the source and destination feature. In terms of authentication purposes ,
the user will be notified of a verification while signing up.</li>
<li>Technological Goals: Location analysis through Google maps is the backbone of
our project. The application will search for the intersection between the userâ€™s
route and all available rides and suggest a shortest possible route to the user.</li>
<li>Quality Goals: The proposed system is user friendly. Good communication will be
established between admin and users. Details of drivers and users will be
maintained through the database.
</li></ul>

## Proposed Solution 

The project will deliver a solution to improve the mobility of our students
through carpooling, a way through which drivers can share their private vehicle
in order to split the cost and users can request a comfortable ride at reasonable
rates. Our project work will go through the conceptual phase first and then the
development phase.
